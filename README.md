# hngx-stageone

### A simple web page with the following elements:
1. User's name.
2. User's Slack profile picture.
3. The current day of the week.
4. The current UTC time in milliseconds.
5. User's track.
6. A link to the user's GitHub repo.

<em>The data-testid attributes are used to identify each element for easy testing.</em>

<em>The JavaScript code gets the current day of the week and current UTC time, and then updates the corresponding elements on the web page.</em>
